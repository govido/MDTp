WDS PXE skip in parallel with FTP Thinclients?
Increase DHCP leasetime from dc tools
Test MDTp with convertibles and tablets that use network adapters
Import GPO for Hybrid Azure and Intune MDM from DC Tools

Begin 1.5:

In-Progress:
- Export hardwarehash to MDTp before install for Intune import / Intune GPO

- Import serialnumber or MAC 
- Change Customsettings from UI (preselected TS, skip TS selection, DB matching patterns)
- Bitlocker key backup to MDTp if TPM module is present and working correctly
- Add local users with TS (users, admins as comma seperated values in TS)
- Extra driver export tool triggers new powershell windows with admin rights, drivers get imported to MDT automatically
- Shorcut to customsettings.ini to edit default TS and SQL settings
- Use only 1 customizable TS for many needs (using only Serialnumber for tablet/wifi only devices, 2 partitions, non domain, no primary PXE etc.)
- Edit custom TS variables after TS creation (change passwords, OU, domain, keys etc.)
- Enable and disable TS variables and tasks (enable 2nd partiton, disable domainjoin, enable local users etc.)
- Set supervisor password on Lenovo devices with special TS and deployment boot (F12, del in boot menu)
- Configure BIOS for Lenovo machines with CSV-files (Demofile for E15gen2 included)
- Metro UI complete rewrite, all UI xml in one file, all working code in 1 collapsable file (#region)
- Switch everything to english -> learn or die
- Status messages in all tabs in the same place
- Code cleanup
- Folder rework, clean up broken TS parts
- Import images with local path not network (network cut and paste needs 2x space, because copies first and deletes the other file, local path moves correctly)
- Domainconfig with template import function, templates will be renamed to domain name, making it even mor portable
- TS info shows custom variables
- Automatic driver import, drivers exported from the tool from 'driver-sample-pc' will be added automatically to MDTp
- Many delete options for drivers, TS, images and more
- PC restart, restart installed domain computers for even easier reinstall

Version 1.4.5:
- Staggered deploy -> every pc install can be started manually or autmatically (making network load easier, if installing large number of clients at once)
- Change imagefiles in tasksequences with 2 clicks
- Filter database entries to edit or delete
- Import only templates from current release version (version number in filename is matched to MDTp_Tool version)
- Streamline status texts
- Insert WoL tools, making installs even easier 
- Refresh database
- Tabbed Interface, Dockpanel
- MDT-Monitoring with Dart-shortcut (right-click)
- WoL from datagrid

Version 1.4:
- Database PC overview in datagrid, query WDS for PXE-options, query CSV-file for install info (mainboard, imagename, TasksequenceID, installdate...)
- DART integration!!! -> remote monitoring WinPE even before the login screen (some PE magic scripts needed)
	- Desktop Optimization Pack 2015 (VLSC) -> DART 10 install->Export Tools.Cab -> edit PE -> Change Unattend.xml for PE start (C:\Programme...\ADK..\Templates) -> Add additional script for Dart to the image / customize which is allowed to update monitoring -> Profit
- BCDedit PXE_boot primary afer install, windows 10 bootloader secondary (making remote install possible)

Version 1.3:
- Expanded domainconfig: local adminpassword, standard-homepage, Windows-10 key (MAK or KMS)
- Dc_tools_copy in installscript and as desktopshortcut
- Import templates with domainconfig domain (making it truly portable)
- MDTp_Tool redesign
- CSV-import -> WDS PXE prestage without F12 presses, tasksequence disables pxe boot on install, CSV-import with assettag to the database
- Tasksequence import
- UIID PC-Infos
- Installscript edit -> domainconfig  -> template_domainconfig is used if no domainconfig.csv is present
- Save assettag if remimporting/new TS from GUI
- Delete CSV -> log assettags, UUID, MAC and hostname to csv -> be able to reimport after delete

Version 1.2:
- WPF window (powershell) for capture TS to enter imagename
- Capture / import custom template
- PC-Info file as formatted CSV instead of txt
- planned task for MDTp-Server (running every 5 minutes)
- Add option to write imagedescription before capturing
- Auto imageimport from the MDTp-Server -> Capture finished creates checkfile on server
- Create PC-Info reports with latest PC data in one file
- Domain-Config Window
- WDS-Server bootimage status
- WDS-Server bootimage on / off (lite / zerotouch)
- deactiviate PXE-Boot in WDS prestage when install starts
- integrate CSV-Buddy to edit / view files
- Customsettings.ini, TasksequenceID sample commented with ' -> uncomment and add your own TS_ID for faster default selection
- Enter inventory no. when installing new PCs or importing CSV to database (Assettag)
- Don't allow special characters in PC names: https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou
- Show OSDComputername during installation, making typing errors obvious
- IT organization branding Litetouch
- Make assettag persistent after reinstall (added SQL-query in WinPE to get info from the database)
- WDS-Status of individual PCs in the MDTp-Tool
- Fix for image-import -> Powershellscript executed from bat-file, otherwise MDT-Powershellmodule won't create OperatingSystems.xml
- Update Deploymentshare image
- Import images in WDS
